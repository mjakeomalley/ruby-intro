puts 3 + 2
puts 3 - 2
puts 3 * 2
puts 3 / 2
puts 3 / 2.0
puts 7 % 4

puts 5 * (2 - 2)

# Perform simple math with numbers

# Strings
puts "Hello, world"

# Combine strings together

puts "Hello, " + "world"

puts "Tacos" * 3

# Variables

food = "Tacos"
number = 5

puts food
puts number

puts food * number

# Combine strings and variables

greeting = "Heyyyy"
welcome_message = "#{greeting}, world!"

# String manipulation
puts welcome_message.upcase
puts welcome_message.reverse
